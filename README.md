# About the data file

Since the csv file is too big to upload to github, I put them to the google drive, here is the shared link:

# Specific data set
The specific data set I chose is the one whose job_id = 187, which means super bowl.
When I did the model for this data set, at the first time, I extracted all the data into csv file. But it seemed that RStudio can't deal with such big file. So I made a sample portion of the origin data file. Since I compare the summary() and other analysis method, which is the same, I used the sample data file instead.
